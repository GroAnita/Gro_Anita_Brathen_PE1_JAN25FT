## About the Project

This web application is my first-year project exam at Noroff.  
It is a simple, modern site for a second hand store—allowing users to browse, search, and interact with listings.

## About the Clients

The Second Hand Company was founded by three passionate women who share one mission: to reduce waste and give quality items a second life. As long-time advocates for sustainability, they built their brand around the belief that pre-owned goods can be both beautiful and responsible.

Their goal is simple — make sustainable shopping accessible, stylish, and enjoyable. By curating pre-loved items and promoting reuse over disposal, they hope to inspire more people to choose environmentally friendly options.

To support their growing vision, they commissioned a modern, user-friendly website that reflects their values and helps customers discover high-quality second-hand products with ease.
